Qico TODO 
---------

- https://sourceforge.net/p/qico/bugs/15/
  The source code repository was migrated from CVS to GIT but the old CVS '$Id'
  lines are still present in source files. Those lines are associated  with a
  user id and date, so change them to be Copyright lines. If they do not other-
  wise have some kind of license information, use some kind of short form
  reference of the overall gico (BSD) license. Can use the user id as a
  reference to who did the last change to the file but may need to review the
  commits to check for any others.

- Update any references to the code repository to be the new SF GIT repo.

- Will need to either update src/cvsdate.h or remove it before creating an
  archive (is it actually used during a build?) (do a test build without it?
  check makefile.in files?) 
- src/cvsdate.h: at least update for version releases? Presumably it was getting
  updated for each change in the cvs repo...  Or use date from whichever is most
  recent;  the Changes or the ChangeLog file.

- ChangeLog: change from using just user name to full email address, or make a
  cross reference note of that info perhaps at the top of the file. (Like
  already present in, for instance, the README file.)

- ChangeLog: change tabs to just spaces.

- The "src/cvsdate.h" file is left over from when primarily using the cvs
  repository.  It is still useful to have something like that but find another
  way to do the updates for it besides manually? Match it to the most recent
  entry in ChangeLog? It contains a timestamp consisting of date and time.

- stuff/ftn: should really be renamed as stuff/qico as it only does stop/start
  etc for qico and not any other FTN services.  ("FTN" is too generic.)  Do as
  part of otherwise updating the file? Like changing the "$ID" line (7) to be a
  copyright line.  (It's old & so may not still be valid on current Redhat
  systems.)  The author doesn't otherwise note the license, so just use the
  qico one (BSD).

- qico.spec:  since this should be getting generated from qico.spec.in, why is
  it in the code repository? Just left over from the xe or other version imports?

- https://sourceforge.net/p/qico/bugs/14/
  Rename the 'man' directory as 'doc' and use it for all documentation and
  example files.  Move that type of file from 'stuff' directory to 'doc'.
  For the example shell & perl scripts, use a 'doc/examples' directory instead
  of the existing 'stuff' directory?

- http://sourceforge.net/p/qico/feature-requests/6/
  As part of converting the overall build system from Autoconf/Automake to CMake,
  create a basic set of CMakeList.txt files

- http://sourceforge.net/p/qico/feature-requests/7/  
  Add a basic test framework for Qico using CTest. (CTest can be used separately,
  so may not need to wait until even the basic CMake files are working.)

- http://sourceforge.net/p/qico/bugs/13/
  English versions of the documentation, such as the README and the FAQ files,
  are not available. At least add an English translations of the files, if not
  also make them the primary version.

- Mailing lists 'qico-devel' & 'qico-users' were apparently created at some
  point but have not been used (no archives are showing).

- Instead of using one of the devs email address (rjc, currently) at the 
  AC_INIT line in configure.in, use the devel mailing list email address?
