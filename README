Features
~~~~~~~~
 * Protocols EMSI: ZModem, ZedZap, Hydra (Std, 4k, 8k, 16k), Janus; Binkp.
 * Support 4D Binkley-Style, Amiga-style outbound, FileBoxes, LongNameBoxes.
 * "Muzzle" - a program that allows you to control the operation of mailer (ncurses based).
 * Daemon mode for outgoing calls and muzzle.
 * Asynchronous queue manager and sessions (both incoming and outgoing).
 * Built-in fast compiler c nodelists small indices.
 * Built-in utility for working with outbound resides, more convenient, because monitors
   bsy state and csy files.
 * Substitutions (substs) enabled ip and hidden-line.
 * Check the file flags ban outgoing calls to ports.
 * Built-in "peepers" nodelist and outbound resides.
 * Dynamic configuration - the ability to change most of the parameters
   config during operation depending on various conditions.
 * Ability to limit the time for the session.
 * Support WaZOO-and SRIF-compatible freq processor.
 * Support all kinds of local transformations and path names sent
   files (supports outbound resides ol 'DOS, etc.).
 * Ability to limit the minimum speed of a connection.
 * Ability to pass / retention incoming files.
 * Live Chat (Hydra, Z * and Binkp).
 * Perl-hooks.

Building & Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Optional:
   $ mkdir ../obj_qico
   $ cd ../obj_qico

   $ [path_to/]configure --help
   $ [path_to/]configure [options desired]
   $ make
   $ make install or make install-strip

  Config put in the right place to customize it to fit your needs.
  
Using
~~~~~
 * For outgoing enough qico-d run out of some startup-script
   and poll'y generit by cron.
 * For incoming (if mgetty) need to enter the following line in the
   login.config (mgetty has to be compiled with-DFIDO):
       / FIDO / $ USER $ USER $ BINDIR / qico-a @
   where $ USER and $ BINDIR values of those variables of CONFIG.
 * You can still register in inetd.conf for response to tcp / ip ifcico and (or) binkp.
 * Qcc. All buttons are case sensitive, brief summaries can be accessed by pressing F1.
   There are all very briefly / is obscure, so I will try to explain here.
   If written in a help one button, you have to press it up. In teams
   change the status button on the lower register clears the corresponding flag
   a button in the upper register (with shiftom) - sets. In teams where
   Specified by two buttons (ie one, but in different registers), pressing
   lowercase wonders address for which you want to perform an action,
   and when a button in the upper register (with shiftom) as the address
   uses the current address (one that under the cursor).
   In the address field may be a short form of writing. For example, if your address
   2:5050 / 125 and then type '33 'obtain address 2:5050 / 33, and when you enter' .12 '
   obtain 2:5050 / 125.12. Experiment yourself understand. ;)
   So as the input line editor remembers the last 50 dialed strings
   Scroll by the `up 'and` down', `pgdn` - cleaning.
   For windows you can browse the latest CONNECT 256 lines log keys
   up \ down \ pgup \ pgdn \ home \ end \ ins \ del. Last two scroll on 2 lines.
   In the main window, the log is not flipping. In the chat window, I hope everything is clear.


Notes
~~~~~
# Supports _only_ 4D BSO, because 5D IMHO nafig not needed - just
  produce glitches. When ftn-style Soft loss completely unnoticed, but for the gate,
  if you want f56.n34.z12.othernet.org, not f56.n34.z12.fidonet.org, then
  can juzat domtrans. And then, do not forget the sim and hardlink ;)

 #. REQ is the reason for the call and similar pair. REQ +. FLO for ifcico.

 # Structure. QST:
   <N Popytki> <flags> <Hold Time> <Time undial>
  SP: In the case of regime ND protocol Binkp, after these parameters
   may be even more. they should simply be ignored.

  # All time intervals can be specified in the format d.hh: mm-d.hh: mm
   (Days and / or minutes may be omitted), then they are regarded as
   local time, and in the format Txy, then they are considered relatively UTC.
   Instead, you can simply write 00:00-23:59 CM, instead of 0:00-0:00 - Never
   You can write a few periods separated by commas.
   In the context of intervals can also be used in the format ifcico (sometimes
   it is more convenient).

 # To describe Hidd, just list the few subst'ov one address.
   Nodlistovaya line in this case is ignored, so it must also register
   as subst.

 # Team qctl-f or f in qcc information _only_ issue of nodelist without
   accounting subst'ov!

# If you have absolutely no sheets and they are not needed, you still have
   register at least one (though non-existent) and create an empty sheet
   index by running 'qico-n'.

 # If you want to reread the config files, do not do "killall-HUP qico", because it
   extinguish all open sessions right thing to do ;) qctl-R.
   This also applies to "killall qico" / "qctl-q".
  SP: open session is not suppressed, but management ceases to be impossible.
   but in general, you can simply press the `R 'in qcc, configs normally reread.

 # All the information that is used to check conditions in the config
   emsi taken up from the nodelist and subst'ov, and after - from the resulting emsi.

# As freq processor can take my same ifextrp-pk (is there, where qico) or
  original ifextrp by Serge Oskin. SP: and it is now possible to use the
  SRIF-compatible freq processor that typically more functional.

 # "History" is made for quick and easy generation of statistics (should be enough
   one awk). Following format (one line - one session):
   <line>, <time>, <length>, <address>, [P] [L] {I | O} {1 | 0}, <sent_bytes>, <recd_bytes>
   where <line> - terminal or tcpip for tcp / ip-sessions
       <time> and <length> - in seconds (unix time)
       P - protected, L - listed,
       I / O - inbound / outbound,
       1/0 - successful / failed

 # FileBox'y made by analogy with ifcico - files are given to the very end,
   poll'a not cause after successful transmission removed. Processed
   Only regular files and symlinks. LongNameBox'y - the same, only
   browse the directory with a name like '$ longboxpath / zone.net.node.point'.
  SP: Now kick understands Flavor boxes, ie zone.net.node.point.flavor.
   Flavor d, f, n, i, c causes a poll, h - causes. Flavor if not specified,
   then its value is taken from the word `defboxflv '.

 # I guess that description of the option in the config mapout more than vague, so
   try to explain in Russian ;) So, convert names are divided into two
   type - the conversion of local names, which will be open for
   Shipping and names by which files get the remote side.
   Conversion specified in big letters + mappath only affect
   local name, they must adjust so that the files in the prescribed loshka
   mailer could not open, and the remaining conversion can already be configured as
   you want to remota received files.
